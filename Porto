<h4>Transportation in Porto</h4>
The metro's 'violet' line provides a handy service to the airport. A one-way ride from the city centre costs 1.80 euros and takes about 45 minutes.
<br />
A daytime taxi costs 20 to 25 euros to/from the centre. Taxis authorised to run from the airport are labeled 'Maia' and/or 'Vila Nova de Telha'; the rank is just outside the Arrivals Hall. In peak-traffic time, allow an hour or more between the city centre and the airport. <br />

<h4>More on Getting around Porto</h4>
Car and Motorcycle:<br />
Avoid driving in central Porto if possible. Narrow, one-way streets, construction and heavy traffic can turn 500m into half a morning. Street parking is tight, with a two-hour maximum stay on weekdays. There is no limit on weekends and parking spaces are more readily available.

       Porto (Portuguese pronunciation: ['portu]), also known as Oporto in English,is the second-largest city in Portugal, after Lisbon, and one of the major urban areas in Southwestern Europe. The urban area of Porto, which extends beyond the administrative limits of the city, has a population of 1.4 million in an area of 389 km2 (150 sq mi), making it the second-largest urban area in Portugal. It is recognized as a Gamma-level global city by the Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) Study Group,the only Portuguese city besides Lisbon to be recognised as a global city.

                <br />
                Located along the Douro river estuary in Northern Portugal, Porto is one of the oldest European centres, and its historical core was proclaimed a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1996. The western part of its urban area extends to the coastline of the Atlantic Ocean. Its settlement dates back many centuries, when it was an outpost of the Roman Empire. Its combined Celtic-Latin name, Portus Cale, has been referred to as the origin of the name "Portugal", based on transliteration and oral evolution from Latin.
